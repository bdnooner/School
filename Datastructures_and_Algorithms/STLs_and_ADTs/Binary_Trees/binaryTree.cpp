/*
 * Binary Tree
If a node in a binary tree has no left or right children, it is called a leaf. Observe that nodes 37 and 40 are leaves in the example above. A node that has at least one child is called a non leaf or an interior node. Twenty and 23 are examples of interior nodes. The height of a node is the number of nodes in the longest path from the node to a leaf minus one. The concept of a height of a node can be defined recursively in terms of the heights of the children.
